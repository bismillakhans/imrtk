                The Institute of Mathematics Research and Train-
) is aimed at organizing workshops in collabo- IMRT ing(
ration with colleges offering M.Sc. programme in Mathematics
for improving mathematics education and orienting
to research activities. As part of it the educators
and researchers of IMRT came forward by conducting
“Mathematics En- series of workshops under the title
with richment Programme for Graduate Students”
special mention on problem solving sessions.
During 2015-16, IMRT organized a workshop on “Foundations
of Linear Algebra”which was held at St. Albert’s
College, Ernakulam. During 2016-17 workshop was organized
on “Foundations of Real Analysis” in the six
colleges: University College, Thiruvananthapuram, St.
Alberts College Ernakulam, SB College Changanassery,
Govt. College Chalakkudy, St.Gregorios College Kottarakkara
and SD College Alappuzha.
